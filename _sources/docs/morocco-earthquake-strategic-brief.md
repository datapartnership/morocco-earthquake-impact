# Data Lab Strategic Brief: Morocco Earthquake Impact Monitoring

A **Strategic Brief** is a high-level set of recommendations prepared by the [Data Lab](https://wbdatalab.org) that address a given challenge. Recommendations may include internal and external data resources, specific colleagues and/or teams with relevant expertise, data management best practices, suggestions for exploration, and/or a list of relevant resources and
similar projects.

Should you have any questions about the Brief, please contact: datalab@worldbank.org

## Project Overview

In September 2023, a powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake and a series of strong tremors and aftershocks wrought substantial damages in central Morocco. As of time of writing, the death toll has passed 2,800 and the earthquake’s aftermath is substantially impacting the people, infrastructure, and local economy of the two countries. [The World Bank issued a statement shortly after the quake, indicating its full support in the wake of the catastrophe]([World Bank Statement on Morocco Earthquake](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/statement/2023/09/09/statement-on-morocco-earthquake). Effective World Bank and donor interventions will require a deep, data-driven understanding of these impacts.

The Morocco Country Economist and Poverty Team team has requested advisory on data and analytical resources that may support measurement and monitoring of socio-economic impacts, including population displacement and business impacts.

The **Data Lab** advisory is presented in three sections:

- **Data Collection and Acquisition**: Identified data resources that could support the earthquake socio-economic impact analysis.

- **Data Management**: Recommendations for managing derived project datasets.

- **Data Analytics and Insight Dissemination**: A menu of proposals for analytical work that could be coordinated through the Lab.

## Data Collection and Acquisition

*This section includes a range of data collection and acquisition recommendations, such as open data resources, leveraging private data partnerships, current World Bank subscriptions and licenses, survey solutions, and remote sensing.*

### Boundaries and shapefiles

Morocco's borders have long been in contention making the boundary files difficult to publicly release or report on. We identified two data sources from which boundaries can be obtained. Although GADM is not a United Nayions' source, it provides boudnaries at admin 3 and 4 levels which makes it easier to measure the impact of the earthquake.

## Data Management

*This section includes data privacy policy, data storage and access policy and infrastructure, compute infrastructure, data license compliance, data security classifications, data sovereignty policy, etc.*

### Privacy and Security Considerations

At this stage, the Lab does not have specific recommendations to the team regarding data management. That said, the Lab would like to ensure the team is aware that some analyses conducted over the course of the earthquake relief project may involve use of sensitive data and/or generate sensitive results. The Bank has two sets of guiding policies for secure data management and for protecting the privacy of individuals. The
Task Team Leader and team members working closely with sensitive data and/or results are advised to review these policies before beginning project implementation.

- [World Bank Policy on Data Privacy](https://ppfdocuments.azureedge.net/ca36fdc4-5191-4d89-a49d-6189a98bad86.pdf)

- [World Bank Policy on Access to Information](https://ppfdocuments.azureedge.net/3693.pdf)

### Data Storage

As data are sourced and analyzed, the Lab recommends they is added to the World Bank Development Data Hub. This will ensure data are available to all Bank staff (as
appropriate) for reuse, minimizing additional effort and duplication of acquisition by other teams. For assistance making data available, contact **Rochelle O’Hagan** (<u>rohagan@worldbank.org</u>).

## Data Analytics and Insight Dissemination

*With acquired data and sufficient data management procedures and infrastructure in place, how do we responsibly generate and share insights from these data? This section includes economics and statistical analysis, data science (AI/ML), app development, geospatial analytics, code collaboration best practices, reproducible code best practices, data product licensing, etc.*

<br>

The Morocco Country Economist and Poverty team have specifically requested recommendations for measuring and monitoring the following:

- Demographics update for affected areas (last household surveys were conducted in 2013);
- Impact on tourism, short and mid-term;
- General impact on well-being of more vulnerable populations; and
- Other potential macro-economic / regional economic impacts.

For each activity, the Data Lab can generate reusable methods and initial insights, and then train Bank teams to continue adjusting the methodology and generating the insights themselves, as needed. To the extent possible, insights will be geospatially aggregated to a granular level, enabling the CMU to quickly visualize correlations between indicators by location – e.g., a relative damage index, population demographics, population movement, nighttime lights, internet availability. To the extent possible, the Lab would welcome collaboration with other teams preparing such indicators, to ensure comparability. 

The Lab coordinates the production of analytical work with team members from across the Bank, including (but not limited to) colleagues from DEC Analytics and Tools, Global Operations Support Team, GFDRR, Development Data Hub, Development Data Partnership, ITS Technology and Innovation Lab, and ITS.

### I.      Understanding Displacement Patterns

The Data Lab can undertake the following activities to better understand population movements (who, where, and when) resulting from the earthquake:

| General Approach    | With the popularization of smartphone usage and connectivity across the world, the last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility datasets, such call detail records, geo-tagged posts from social media platforms and generated from GPS devices. These datasets have propelled a [rich scientific production](https://www.semanticscholar.org/search?q=mobility%20data&sort=relevance) on various applications of mobility analysis, ranging from epidemiology to disaster resilience, urban planning and transportation engineering.<br>Through the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/),staff now have access to high-frequency location-based mobility data, constituted of high temporal and spatial resolution timestamped geographical points generated by GPS-enabled devices.<br> By overlaying population and socioeconomic data with mobility data, the project team will be able to produce an analysis based on the estimation of home locations and population displacement to be delivered on a weekly basis. The results could shed light on the earthquake's effects on different areas and/or populations aggregated by seismic intensity, wealth group or additional features that become available.<br> In addition, a point of  interest rate visit analysis may show to what degree the decrease in movement and activity in business and commercial centers may correlate to the economic outlook, comparing with historical data.The project team may leverage both Meta (pending availaility) and mobile device generated data, as well as official UN statsitics and other data sources as they become available to support cross-validation. <br>All analytics will be supported by at least two data sources, where possible – for example, combining Meta movement statistics with mobile-device location data and comparing with official UNHCR data.<br>See also: [Mobility for resilience: displacement analysis &mdash; mobilkit documentation](https://mobilkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/M4R_02_DisplacementAnalysis.html) and [Observed Cross-Border Mobility Traces in Lebanon and Syria](https://datapartnership.org/syria-economic-monitor/notebooks/mobility/README.html) |

| Limitations         | The methodology relies on private intent data in the form of mobile location data. In other words, the input data was not produced or collected to analyze the population of interest or address the research question as its primary goal but repurposed for the public good. The< benefits and caveats when using private intent data have been extensively discussed in the [World Development Report 2021](https://wdr2021.worldbank.org/). <br> On the one hand, the mobility data panel is spatially and temporally granular and readily available, on the other hand it is created as a convenience sampling which constitutes an important source of bias. The panel composition is not entirely known and susceptible to change, the data collection and the composition of the mobility data panel cannot be controlled.<br>Due to the nature of the problem and the cardinality, the results can be complex and better analyzed and interpreted when looking at the interactive maps, instead of annual indicators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### II. Understanding Economic Impacts

The Lab proposes focusing on the following key business activity and business
supporting infrastructure indicators:

#### II.A. Observed Electricity Usage at Night

By comparing pre- and post-earthquake nighttime light data, we can identify changes in availability of electricity, mass movements of people, and changes in oil refining (through flaring). Some of our sample work using this methodology can be seen [as part of the Syria Economic Monitor.](https://datapartnership.org/syria-economic-monitor/notebooks/ntl-analysis/README.html) Monitoring nighttime light data over a longer historical time period -- e.g., since 2013, when the last household surveys were conducted in the affected region -- can also shed light on current demographics of the impacted population.

| Limitations         | Nighttime lights are a common data source for measuring local economic activity. However, it is a proxy that is strongly—although imperfectly—correlated with measures of interest, such as population, local GDP, and wealth.

| Limitations         | Meta Network Coverage Maps are only pertaining to Facebook users. In Morocco, as of March 2022, there were more than  26 million active Facebook users. The population of the country as of 2021 was more than 37 million. Although this could make Facebook data fairly reliable in Morocco, it does not cover everyone. <br>Ookla speedtest data is a collection of speed tests conducted on the Ookla platform. This dataset also does not cover the entire population. Additionally, their dataset is crowdsourced, and their sampling methodology is untested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### II.C. Observed Business Facebook Page Activity

Many local businesses use Facebook as their primary business website. Facebook records levels of activity on these pages, aggregates activity by location and sector, and presents as generalized trend indicators for levels of business activity.

| Limitations         | Business Activity Trends captures the rate of posting (posts and visits) on Facebook business pages. Thus, offline and off-Facebook activities are not captured and along with social media usage, connectivity and cultural customs, may contribute as serious limitation and source of bias. In other words. the index is not representative of the other business happening in the area.<br>There is also a bias towards the service sector, which is more likely to be active on Facebook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### III. Understanding Social Impacts

Since the last household survey in the region was conducted in 2013, the team will attempt to use alternative data to provide insights into trends since that period. <br>

To get a sense of “need intensity,” the team can explore use of the Google Health
Trends API (available through the Development Data Partnership) to determine
temporally and by region changes in queries related to key terms provided by
the Task Team (e.g., ““water,” “money transfer,” “pediatrician,” “hospital”). The method can be adjusted to incorporate other datasets, such as social media data (e.g., Twitter which has roughly 1 million users in Morocco).<br>

| Limitations         | Premise data are crowdsourced and may not be representative of the affected population. <br>Google Trends relies on people with an active internet connection to search, which excludes people without internet access or who do not use Google search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### IV. Dissemination and Capacity Building

Since analytical results from this work could support additional teams and
counterparts, the team has created a centralized repository of all datasets used in analytical work using SharePoint to ensure all data are accessible (where licensing permits), and that all methodologies are similarly made available
through [GitHub](https://github.com/worldbank), so that others can reproduce the results. See the starter code respository for this project, here: [GitHub - datapartnership/morocco-earthquake-impact: Alternative data analytics for understanding impacts of the 2023 Morocco earthquake](https://github.com/datapartnership/morocco-earthquake-impact)

Additionally, the Lab can produce a web-based map for layering indicators for ready
comparative analysis, as well as an Excel workbook for ease of indicator dissemination
across the widest possible audience, upon request.

### Potential Partners and Collaborators

- The World Bank participates in a collaboration with the **UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Joint Data Center (JDC)** ([https://www.jointdatacenter.org/](https://www.jointdatacenter.org/)), which supports data collection on internally displaced peoples. The team may consider reaching out to the World Bank focal point for this collaboration, Harriet Kasidi Mugera ([hmugera@worldbank.org](mailto:hmugera@worldbank.org)), to determine what data may be available on displaced peoples that would be relevant.

- The [**UN Pulse Lab Jakarta**](https://www.unglobalpulse.org/lab/jakarta/) has previously developed methodologies for monitoring [economic shock impacts using banking data,](https://www.unglobalpulse.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CameraReady-13.pdf) [internal population movement](https://medium.com/pulse-lab-jakarta/understanding-population-movement-after-the-2018-central-sulawesi-natural-disasters-70ab95b7741b) using mobile phone data, and [disaster response management](https://medium.com/pulse-lab-jakarta/managing-relevant-information-in-the-aftermath-of-natural-disasters-launching-pljs-latest-data-de3b4cbae07b) using social media data. These methodologies may also be applicable to earthquake response. If the team were interested in collaboration, enquiries could be made to Pulse Lab Jakarta ([plj@un.or.id](mailto:plj@un.or.id); please cc: [datalab@worldbank.org)](mailto:datalab@worldbank.org)

### Development Data Partnership’s Community and Documentation

The [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org) fosters a community of data
practitioners and maintains a robust data documentation and code collaboration
platform based on GitHub, which is recognized as a good practice in the World
Bank and in partner international organizations. See more at [https://docs.datapartnership.org](https://docs.datapartnership.org).
