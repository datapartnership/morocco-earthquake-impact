| A   | Observed Electricity Usage at Night   | By comparing pre- and post-earthquake nighttime light data, we identify changes in availability of electricity, mass movements of people, and changes in oil refining (through flaring) | This data is obtained using satellite imagery and can be subject to cloud cover and have high values in locations where there is gas flaring                                                                                    | 2, 11,5                    |
| B   | Observed Change in Critical Needs     | Survey data from Premise and results from Google search trends are combined to udnerstand the needs of people in earthquake impacted areas                                              | Premise data has low representativeness due to few citizens surveyed.                                                                                                                                                           | 12,6,5,2                   |
